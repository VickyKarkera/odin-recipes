        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>For the crispiest fried rice, use leftover long-grain rice, such as jasmine. Freshly cooked rice and/or short-grain rice will be stickier and fail to crisp.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 teaspoons canola oil, divided</li>
                <li>4 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>2/3 cup chopped carrots</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
                <li>1 cup sliced green onions, plus more for garnish</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>4 cups chilled cooked rice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup less-sodium soy sauce, or to taste</li>
                <li>yum yum sauce, to taste</li>
                <li>chili crisp, for serving</li>
                <li>chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish</li>
                <li>4 large fried eggs (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat; add 1 teaspoon oil. To scramble eggs, cook beaten eggs in hot oil, gently folding occasionally with a spatula, until eggs reach desired consistency, about 2 minutes. Transfer eggs to a plate. Remove wok from heat; carefully wipe out wok. Return wok to high heat.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining 3 teaspoons oil. Add carrots, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring constantly, 2 minutes. Stir in peas and green onions; cook, stirring constantly, until peas are heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Add rice, scrambled eggs, and soy sauce to wok. Cook, stirring until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Top servings with yum yum sauce. Serve with chili crisp and garnish with green onion and/or cilantro. If you like, top each serving with a fried egg.</li>
